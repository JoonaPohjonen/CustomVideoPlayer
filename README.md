  ## Overview

  Goal of this project was to create a custom video player that can be viewed in the browser. I wanted to build the video player from the ground up all by myself. The point was to learn what it takes to make a simple video player with some HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. The features implemented into the video player are play/pause button, sound contorls, fullscreen capability, and a mute/unmute button. You can also see the length of the video and the timestamp of your location on the videos timeline. Video timeline and contorls also hide them selves when out of the focus, as in when the mouse moves away from the contorls.
